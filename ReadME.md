### Capstone Project: Real Estate Data Science Application  

This project leverages data science techniques to provide insights, predictions, and recommendations in the real estate domain, culminating in a user-friendly application.  

#### Key Highlights:  

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**:  
  Real estate data was scraped from 99acres and other property websites, cleaned, merged, and enriched with engineered features like luxury scores and furnish details.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Patterns and relationships were uncovered using univariate/multivariate analysis, outlier detection, and missing value imputation.  

- **Feature Selection**:  
  Techniques like correlation analysis, LASSO, SHAP, and gradient boosting were used to identify impactful variables.  

- **Price Prediction Models**:  
  Multiple regression models were compared, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and ElasticNet. The best model was deployed via Streamlit for user-friendly property price predictions.  

- **Analytics Module**:  
  Interactive visualizations (geographical maps, scatter plots, pie charts) were created for data exploration and market insights.  

- **Recommender System**:  
  A recommendation engine provides personalized suggestions for properties based on amenities, price, and location advantages.  

- **Deployment**:  
  The application, including prediction, analytics, and recommendation modules, was deployed on **RENDER**, ensuring accessibility and ease of use.  

This project integrates robust data science workflows with real-world applications, offering users valuable tools to make informed real estate decisions.
